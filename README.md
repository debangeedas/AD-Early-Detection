# Research on Early Detection of Alzhiemer's Disease

### Project Problem Statement: 
Alzhiemer’s disease (AD) remains a significant challenge due to a limited understanding of the gene expression changes that drive its progression and lack of effective therapies targeting these mechanisms. While genes like RASGEF1B, SLC26A3, and LINGO1 are associated with cellular stress response, synaptic stability, and neuroinflammation, their specific roles through various Braak stages in AD are unclear. This project aims to address this knowledge gap by using ML/AI data analysis to quantify and compare the expression levels of these genes in AD patients versus normal subjects. Our research questions include: How does the upregulation of these genes evolve across disease stages, and what pathways do they influence that may drive cognitive decline. Our contribution is to identify potential therapeutic targets by examining the cellular impacts of gene dysregulation, with a goal to develop inhibitory strategies. This innovation holds promise for early intervention and drug development, potentially reducing AD progression and associated healthcare costs.
